Port of google-diff-match-patch to C
====================================

This is a C language port of Neil Fraser's google-diff-match-patch code.

~~Right now, this is focused on the `diff` part of `diff-match-patch`~~ This can now also return a string of the diff text - woot! It
contains APIs to compare two blocks on text and return a structure
containing the list of differences (as shared, inserted, and deleted
sections).

Getting Started
---------------

This library is in an early state, so be prepared to have to bend it to
your will a bit.  Public APIs are declared in `include/dmp.h`.  A basic
Makefile is included.

```sh
$ make
cc -g -Isrc -Iinclude -DSTDC -D_GNU_SOURCE  -Wall -Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers -std=c99 -O2  -fPIC   -c -o src/dmp.o src/dmp.c
cc -g -Isrc -Iinclude -DSTDC -D_GNU_SOURCE  -Wall -Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers -std=c99 -O2  -fPIC   -c -o src/dmp_pool.o src/dmp_pool.c
rm -f libdmp.a
ar cq libdmp.a src/dmp.o src/dmp_pool.o
ranlib libdmp.a

$ make test
cc -o dmp_test -g -Isrc -Iinclude -DSTDC -D_GNU_SOURCE  -Wall -Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers -std=c99 -O2  -fPIC test/dmp_test.c test/dmp_test_internals.c -L. -ldmp

$ ./dmp_test
...done
..done
...................
> "ax\x09"
-"a", +"\xda\x80", ="x", -"\x09", +"\x00"
< "\xda\x80x\x00"
.
> "1ayb2"
-"1", ="a", -"y", ="b", -"2", +"xab"
< "abxab"
.
> "abcy"
+"xaxcx", ="abc", -"y"
< "xaxcxabc"
.done
```

Example API Usage
-----------------

All functions and structures used in this library are prefixed with
`dmp_`.  To generate a diff, you use a function to create a `dmp_diff`
object which you can then access and manipulate via other functions.

Here is a silly little example that counts the total length of the "equal"
runs from the diff.

```c
{
	dmp_diff *diff;
	int eq = 0;

	if (dmp_diff_from_strs(&diff, NULL, "string 1", "string 2") != 0)
		handle_error();

	dmp_diff_foreach(diff, how_equal, &eq);
	printf("Strings had %d equal bytes\n", eq);

	dmp_diff_free(diff);
}

int how_equal(
	void *ref, dmp_operation_t op, const void *data, uint32_t len)
{
	int *sum = ref;
	if (op == DMP_DIFF_EQUAL)
		(*sum) += len;
	return 0;
}
```

This shows the basic pattern of diff API usage:

1. Generate a diff
2. Process the diff in some way
3. Free the diff

Diff API
--------

All public functions in the library that could fail return an `int` and
will return 0 for success or -1 for failure.  Functions which cannot fail
will either have a void return or will return a specific other data type
if they are simple data lookups.

Here are the main functions for generating and accessing diffs:

```c
/**
 * Public: Calculate the diff between two texts.
 *
 * This will allocate and populate a new `dmp_diff` object with records
 * describing how to transform `text1` into `text2`.  This returns a diff
 * with byte-level differences between the two texts.  You can use one of
 * the diff transformation functions below to modify the diffs to word or
 * line level diffs, or to align diffs to UTF-8 boundaries or the like.
 *
 * diff - Pointer to a `dmp_diff` pointer that will be allocated.  You must
 *        call `dmp_diff_free()` on this pointer when done.
 * options - `dmp_options` structure to control diff, or NULL to use defaults.
 * text1 - The FROM text for the left side of the diff.
 * len1 - The number of bytes of data in `text1`.
 * text2 - The TO text for the right side of the diff.
 * len2 - The number of bytes of data in `text2`.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the diff was successfully generated, -1 on failure.  The
 * only current failure scenario would be a failed allocation.  Otherwise,
 * some sort of diff should be generated..
 */
extern int dmp_diff_new(
	dmp_diff **diff,
	const dmp_options *options,
	const char *text1,
	uint32_t    len1,
	const char *text2,
	uint32_t    len2);

/**
 * Public: Generate diff from NUL-terminated strings.
 *
 * This is a convenience function when you know that you are diffing
 * NUL-terminated strings.  It simply calls `strlen()` and passes the
 * results along to `dmp_diff_new` (plus it deals correctly with NULL
 * strings, passing them in a zero-length texts).
 *
 * diff - Pointer to a `dmp_diff` pointer that will be allocated.  You must
 *        call `dmp_diff_free()` on this pointer when done.
 * options - `dmp_options` structure to control diff, or NULL to use defaults.
 * text1 - The FROM string for the left side of the diff.  Must be a regular
 *         NUL-terminated C string.
 * text2 - The TO string for the right side of the diff.  Must be a regular
 *         NUL-terminated C string.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the diff was successfully generated, -1 on failure.  The
 * only current failure scenario would be a failed allocation.  Otherwise,
 * some sort of diff should be generated..
 */
extern int dmp_diff_from_strs(
	dmp_diff **diff,
	const dmp_options *options,
	const char *text1,
	const char *text2);

/**
 * Public: Free the diff structure.
 *
 * Call this when you are done with the diff data.
 *
 * diff - The `dmp_diff` object to be freed.
 */
extern void dmp_diff_free(dmp_diff *diff);

/**
 * Public: Iterate over changes in a diff list.
 *
 * Invoke a callback on each hunk of a diff.
 *
 * diff - The `dmp_diff` object to iterate over.
 * cb - The callback function to invoke on each hunk.
 * cb_ref - A reference pointer that will be passed to callback.
 *
 * Returns 0 if iteration completed successfully, or any non-zero value
 * that was returned by the `cb` callback function to terminate iteration.
 */
extern int dmp_diff_foreach(
	const dmp_diff *diff,
	dmp_diff_callback cb,
	void *cb_ref);
```

Status
------

The library is currently at version **0.1.1**.  There has only really been
one iteration on the core functionality and then one minor update to
reorganize and clean things up a bit.

At this point, the basic Myers diff code works, although I haven't
implemented all of the optimizations from the upstream library yet.  I
haven't written any of the diff formatting helpers from the original
library yet, nor have I started on the match or patch related code yet.
